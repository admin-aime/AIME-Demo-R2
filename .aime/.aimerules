## Development Guidelines

### AIME Method Layers
1. **Customer Personas** - User types and their needs
2. **Functions & Features** - Core functionality mapping
3. **Experience Lists** - User interface screens and interactions
4. **Information Lists** - Data structures and models
5. **Knowledge Lists** - Business rules and logic
6. **Service Lists** - Backend APIs and functions

### Code Standards
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintain clean, readable code structure
- Add appropriate error handling and validation
- Test functionality before marking tasks complete

## Knowledge Base

### Lessons Learned
#### AIME Discovered
1. When building air quality monitoring systems, it's crucial to implement proper data validation and quality control measures. Real-world sensor data can be noisy and contain outliers, so having automated validation rules helps maintain data integrity and reliability for compliance reporting.
2. For environmental monitoring applications, using time-series databases or optimized database schemas is essential for handling large volumes of sensor data efficiently. The current SQLite implementation works for development but would need to be upgraded to a more robust solution like PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for production use.
3. For air quality platforms, real-time data visualization is crucial. Using Socket.IO for WebSocket connections ensures users see live updates without page refreshes. The AQI calculation should follow EPA standards for consistency and regulatory compliance.
4. When building environmental monitoring systems, data validation is critical. Sensor data can be noisy or contain outliers, so implementing quality control checks (like detecting stuck sensors or impossible values) prevents bad data from affecting analysis and alerts.
